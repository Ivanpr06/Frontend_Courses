# Frontend_Courses 🖥️
In this repository, you will find several courses I completed independently while exploring new aspects of backend programming.

## 💻 Courses 
<ul>
  <li><h3>Courses of JavaScript 📱</h3>

  <p>In these courses, you can see some of my first steps learning JavaScript. The initial courses are simpler, focusing on understanding the syntax and how the language works. In the later courses, I worked on more complex exercises, such as a weather application, a to-do list, and even a copy of an Amazon page with a shopping cart. These projects helped me gain a deeper understanding of the most popular tools for web development, which I find incredibly interesting.</p>

    <p>In this course, you can find information about a MoureDev course by Brais Moure that anyone can watch on YouTube. He teaches us a large amount of useful information about Python, such as handling         dates, list comprehension, lambdas, higher-order functions, displaying all types of errors in our Python code, file handling, regular expressions, and package management. Moreover, all this theory is        accompanied by a ton of exercises on <a href="https://retosdeprogramacion.com/ejercicios/">Brais's website</a>, which are very useful.</p>
